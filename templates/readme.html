    <p>Let us first talk about the worflow which contributes your organization of tasks.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A new added tasks gets the status <strong>backlog</strong> first.
    In this status you decide if to do or not.</li>
    <li>If to do, move the task to <strong>todo</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you start with the task just move to <strong>in progress</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you are already done move the task to <strong>testing</strong>.</li>
    <li>After all tests just move the task to <strong>done</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's all!</p>

    <h3 id="3-board">3. Board</h3>
    <p>The simpliest way to organize your tasks is to put them on a board and move them in current status.
    This can be done by <strong>drag &amp; drop</strong> of tasks you see on the board.
    Each column represents a special status up to <strong>done</strong></p>
