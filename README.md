# Welcome to JOIN - a simple way to organize your tasks!
> We want to introduce you in a way how to handle tasks within this tool.

## 1. Workflow
Let us first talk about the worflow which contributes your organization of tasks.
- A new added tasks gets the status **backlog** first.
In this status you decide if to do or not.
- If to do, move the task to **todo**.
- If you start with the task just move to **in progress**.
- If you are already done move the task to **testing**.
- After all tests just move the task to **done**.

That's all! 


## Views
### 1. Add task
You add a task by clicking on **add task**.

### 2. Backlog
A new added Task appears in backlog first.
You have an overwiev of all new tasks here.

### 3. Board
The simpliest way to organize your tasks is to put them on a board and move them in current status.
This can be done by **drag & drop** of tasks you see on the board.
Each column represents a special status up to **done**
