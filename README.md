# Welcome to JOIN - a simple way to organize your tasks!
> We want to introduce you in a way how to handle tasks within this tool.

## 1. Workflow
Let us first talk about the worflow which contributes your organization of tasks.
- You can create a task by clicking on **Add Task** in the navigation side bar. 
- A new added task gets the status **backlog** first and moves to **Backlog** (you see it on the incrementing badge next to **Backlog** in the navigation side bar).
In this status you decide if to do or not.
- If to do, the task moves to **Board** (status **To Do**, you see it on the incrementing badge next to **Board** in the navigation side bar).
- On Board you change the status of a task by drag&drop of this task.
- If you decide to move the task to **backlog** just drag it on **Backlog** in the navigation side bar.
- If you start with the task just move to **in progress** (on board).
- If you are already done move the task to **testing**.
- After all tests just move the task to **done**.

## 2. Update a task
- You can easily update a task on Board by clicking on the *edit icon* on each task card.

## 3. Delete a task
- A task can be deleted on Board by clicking on the *delete icon* on each task card.

That's all!
